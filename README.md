# Vaporweather 👤🌴☀️

## Background
Vaporweather will be a standard weather application with [vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) styling. It will be a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app. It will receive weather data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/guide).

## Motivation
At the end of 2020 I took a break from app creation to focus on freecodecamp exercises, earn come certificates for my CV. Come January I'd become pretty rusty at full-stack, particularly the creative aspect of project design. This lead to a bit of a rut. This app is my breakout!

A weather app is a simple example of front-end design and communication with an API. It's an ideal way to wet my feet again.
